# HTML and CSS Learning Journey

This repository documents my first steps into learning about HTML and CSS through the excellent course [HTML and CSS For Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev).

## About the Course
This course introduces one into HTML and CSS in a clear and understandable manner. The basic constructs of the above languages are clearly explained and also how to use them to write web pages that are logically and aesthetically pleasing.

## Current Status
Currently working my way through course material and practices as I go.
Once finished with the course, next steps are to:
 + Reorganize the file structure.
 + To reflect concepts learned, create a "Concepts" file that will be filled with my detailed explanations and examples to help solidify learning.

## Purpose for this Repository
My goal by making this a open-source learning journey is to encourage others to learn HTML and CSS; This may be informative for people learning the same technologies. It will also be helpful in documenting my progress and the processes of learning.

Feel free to explore the repository and follow along as I continue my journey through HTML and CSS. If you have questions or if there's feedback, don't hesitate to ask!
