# Hello HTML X CSS world

**This markdown file will be a documentation to my HTML and CSS learning journey, LET'S START !**  

# Day 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS

Today marked my first day learning HTML and CSS. I started with the fundamentals by creating several practice files where I experimented with basic HTML elements. I learned how to create text content, paragraphs, and multiple types of buttons (including "Subscribe", "Join", "Tweet", "Request now", "Add to cart", and more). I also practiced creating links, specifically adding a GitHub profile link with a target="_blank" attribute to open in a new tab. Coming from a Python background, I found HTML and CSS to be quite enjoyable and more straightforward to work with, as noted in my practice files. This initial exposure has given me a good foundation in basic HTML structure and content creation.
